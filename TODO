- "procedure" => "function"
- "Scheme" => "Racket"

- variable c => pg-c to mark postgresql syntax and results

--------------------

- change simple-result to have unspecified alist instead of string...
- change field-info to have additional alist (after name)

- add operations on prepared-statement (expected param types, etc)

- add security-guard path checks

- clean up types, conversions, etc

- write tests for improved simple query functions

- permit types in param'd queries

- connection-set-notify-callback!, etc; notification struct types
  also, connection option, defaults to void
  convenience function: print-notification takes notification, extracts string, prints
    also print-notification-to-error-port (?)

- eliminate common code (eg, various prepared-statement%)

- sqlite locking?

- sqlite disconnect on custodian shutdown

- bug: create connection, shut down managing custodian, ask connected?
       => output ports may not be shutdown, so says yes but really no
       Solutions: check that ports are still open (?)
                  wrap with custodian-box (?)

- create abstraction that combined finalizer with custodian management (?)
