To do
=====

- write tests for improved simple query functions

- permit type annotations for
  - query params (would help mysql)
  - extra conversions on result fields (eg sqlite, specify date field)

- sqlite: opportunistic conversions based on decltype (eg date, time)

- test, export, and doc kill-safe wrapper

- add fsym arguments to type-writers

- connection-set-notify-callback!, etc; notification struct types
  also, connection option, defaults to void
  convenience function: print-notification takes notification, extracts string, prints
    also print-notification-to-error-port (?)

- figure out sqlite locking

- postgresql array types

- disconnect should always work, even on messed-up connections (eg thread killed)
