To do
=====

- write tests for improved simple query functions

- sqlite locking?

- eliminate CamelCase names?

- permit types in param'd queries

- Scheme -> Racket in docs

- connection-set-notify-callback!, etc; notification struct types
  also, connection option, defaults to void
  convenience function: print-notification takes notification, extracts string, prints
    also print-notification-to-error-port (?)

- eliminate common code (eg, various prepared-statement%)
