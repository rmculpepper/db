To do
=====

- export and doc kill-safe wrapper

- permit type annotations for
  - query params (would help mysql)
  - extra conversions on result fields (eg sqlite, specify date field)

- sqlite: opportunistic conversions based on decltype (eg date, time)

- add fsym arguments to type-writers

- disconnect should always work, even on damaged connections
  (eg kill-thread, custodian shutdown)
