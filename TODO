To do
=====

- finish sqlite

    (query-value c "select x from y where z > ?" 12)

- prune query functions (drop mapfilter ?, add in-query?)

- permit types in param'd queries

- Scheme -> Racket in docs

- connection-set-notify-callback!, etc; notification struct types
  also, connection option, defaults to void
  convenience function: print-notification takes notification, extracts string, prints
    also print-notification-to-error-port (?)
