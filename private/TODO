To do
=====

- clean up mysql classes
- rewrite postgresl msg layer (?)

- avoid creating *-infos, keep as vectors, interp by dbsys

- doc: enumerate errors

- strict mode by default: error if backend result type unknown

- test sql-interval type
  - and add to ODBC (easy as result, complicated as param (I think))

- test odbc

----

- add sql-bits datatype for BIT, VARBIT types

- printers for sql-* structs

- GC postgresql and mysql prepared-statements to close descriptors

- sqlite: allow configurable behavior on SQLITE_BUSY
  eg retry n times, retry forever, retry w/ timeout, fail
  (is db locked only for write or for whole transaction?)

- add "[fatal]" to fatal error messages (where feasible)

- some parts of docs are Linux-centric, especially ODBC part; broaden

- clean up le/be/host in generic/io, odbc

- export and doc kill-safe wrapper

- permit type annotations for
  - query params (would help mysql, odbc)
  - extra conversions on result fields (eg sqlite, specify date field)

- sqlite: opportunistic conversions based on decltype (eg date, time)

- disconnect should always work, even on damaged connections
  (eg kill-thread, custodian shutdown)

----

bug: mysql concurrency tests sometimes fail
  - temporary fix: always wrap mysql connection in kill-safe proxy
