To do
=====

- document util/connect

----

Types

- better handling of unsupported param types and result types
  (may need to handle differently)

- test sql-interval type
  - and add to ODBC (easy as result, complicated as param (I think))

- add sql-bits datatype for BIT, VARBIT types

- permit type annotations for
  - query params (would help mysql, odbc)
  - extra conversions on result fields (eg sqlite, specify date field)

- sqlite: opportunistic conversions based on decltype (eg date, time)

----

- test statement-generators

- doc: enumerate errors
- document exn:fail:sql, when used, when not used, links to SQLSTATE docs?

- figure out ODBC and unicode (need to use WCHAR?)

- sqlite: allow configurable behavior on SQLITE_BUSY
  eg retry n times, retry forever, retry w/ timeout, fail
  (is db locked only for write or for whole transaction?)

- some parts of docs are Linux-centric, especially ODBC part; broaden

- clean up le/be/host in generic/io, odbc

- disconnect should always work, even on damaged connections
  (eg kill-thread, custodian shutdown)
