To do
=====

- test odbc

----

- sqlite: allow configurable behavior on SQLITE_BUSY
  eg retry n times, retry forever, retry w/ timeout, fail
  (is db locked only for write or for whole transaction?)

- add "[fatal]" to fatal error messages (where feasible)

- some parts of docs are Linux-centric, especially ODBC part; broaden

- clean up le/be/host in generic/io, odbc

- export and doc kill-safe wrapper

- permit type annotations for
  - query params (would help mysql, odbc)
  - extra conversions on result fields (eg sqlite, specify date field)

- sqlite: opportunistic conversions based on decltype (eg date, time)

- disconnect should always work, even on damaged connections
  (eg kill-thread, custodian shutdown)

----

bug: mysql concurrency tests sometimes fail
  - temporary fix: always wrap mysql connection in kill-safe proxy
